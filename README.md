# Code Wars Practice (Node.js)

A simple Node.js project to practice Code Wars challenges.

## Usage

1. Add your challenges in the `challenges/` directory (one file per challenge).
2. Edit `index.js` to import and run your challenge functions.
3. Run all tests and see outputs in the console:

```
npm start
```

---

- Each challenge file should export a function.
- Edit `index.js` to test your solutions.
